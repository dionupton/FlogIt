# üí∞ FlogIt: Demonstrative Auction Platform

Welcome to **FlogIt**, my demo auction platform project. Written with modern development practices, this README provides a overview of the technologies, methodologies, and architectural choices behind this project.

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities

- **Real-time Bidding**: Seamlessly participate in live auctions, placing and updating bids in real-time.
- **User Authentication**: A bare-bones implementation of Duende Identity Service allowing secure registration and login functionality for users
- **Notifications**: Real-time alerts on bid activities and auction progress.

- **Frontend**: Utilized Next.js, capitalizing on its capabilities to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Developed on the ASP.NET Core microservices framework. Duende IdentityServer is integrated for authentication, SignalR for real-time interactions, and RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for its robustness in handling relational data and MongoDB for its flexibility with NoSQL storage.
- **Infrastructure**: Orchestrated the entire setup using Kubernetes, ensuring seamless container management and deployment.

## üåç Deployment Overview

- **Live Application**: Experience the platform firsthand at [FlogIt Demo App](https://app.flogitdemoapp.co.uk).
- **Identity Server**: Isolated hosting to optimize authentication processes.
- **Microservices**: Hosted on cloud-based Kubernetes clusters, emphasising scalability and resilience.

## üåê Frontend Services

### Web Application

Constructed with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, the web application ensures an intuitive user experience. It communicates with backend services, providing users with real-time auction and bidding functionalities.

## üîß Backend Services

### Auction Service

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Functionality**: Centralized management of auction activities. Integrates with RabbitMQ for synchronous updates and provides endpoints for auction-related tasks.

### Bidding Service

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Functionality**: Handles bid lifecycle, communicating with the Auction Service via gRPC. RabbitMQ assists in delivering instantaneous bid notifications.

### Gateway Service

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Functionality**: Manages incoming requests, ensuring they're dispatched to the appropriate service.

### Identity Service

- **Framework**: Duende IdentityServer
- **Functionality**: Oversees authentication and authorization, dispensing JWT tokens for verified sessions.

### Notification Service

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core SignalR
- **Functionality**: Ensures users receive real-time notifications, leveraging the capabilities of SignalR and RabbitMQ.

### Search Service

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Functionality**: Provides efficient item search capabilities, interacting with the Auction Service and utilizing RabbitMQ for real-time updates.

## üöÄ Microservice Architecture

Each microservice in FlogIt is optimized for deployment within a Kubernetes environment:

- **Auction Service**: (`dionupton/auction-svc` container).
- **Bidding Service**: (`dionupton/bid-svc` container).
- **Gateway Service**: (`dionupton/gateway-svc` container).
- **Notification Service**: (`dionupton/notify-svc` container).
- **Search Service**:(`dionupton/search-svc` container).

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL**: Employed for its reliability and ACID-compliant properties.
- **MongoDB**: Chosen for its adaptability in handling dynamic data structures.

## üîÑ GitHub CI/CD Integration

The project integrates a CI/CD pipeline, ensuring automated testing, building, and deployment. This approach guarantees code quality and streamlined deployments, reflecting industry best practices.

## üêç Python Bot Functionalities

The `bot.py` script in the repository simulates various auction-related activities. This service, like the Identity Service, runs completely seperate from the main services.

- **Logging**: Maintains a log of the bot's activities, which can be accessed via the `/logs` endpoint.
- **Token Management**: Obtains access tokens for users `bob` and `alice` to authenticate their requests.
- **Auction Creation**: Periodically generates new auctions with randomized attributes.
- **Bid Placement**: Places bids on ongoing auctions, ensuring it doesn't bid on its own auctions.
- **Scheduling**: Uses scheduled tasks to periodically fetch auction data, create new auctions, and place bids.
- **Flask Application**: Operates a Flask app to serve the `/logs` endpoint and oversee the bot's activities.
